# Torch!

## Story

You're an amatuer spelunker in search of a lost treasure rumored to be located
in the depths of a cave. However, deadly monsters hide in the shadows, meaning
your torch - not your weapon - holds your greatest chance of getting out alive.

## How to Play

Darkness will kill you, so only move to lit spaces! Your torch has a limited
amount of fuel, but it can be rekindled at bonfires spread around the cave.

Your presence in the cave will attract attention from creatures who might not
appreciate being woken up.

Collect treasure (c or C) by moving the player character (@) over it.
